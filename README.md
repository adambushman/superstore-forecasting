# Superstore Sales Forecasting

Time series forecasting project for CS3580, Weber State University

## Description

Our goal is to perform a forecasting analysis on a datset of choice. We selected a dataset comprised of superstore sales from Kaggle (full reference below). You'll find graphical, statistical, and machine learning analysis in Python, along with a presentation made for the course. 

Project was collaborated between [Adam Bushman](https://github.com/adambushman) and [Zach Manning](https://github.com/zmanning13).
